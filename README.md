# AWFEL
Apple Workout Fitness Export Linker (AWFEL) -python script that takes pictures of your swim workout splits from iphone (11 splits per picture) as an inputs, uses OCR to convert to text, formats the: split number, total distance, and split time into tabular data, and then exports to excel spreadsheet for further analysis, and provides analysis on best swim intervals.
This is a work in progress.  Have ideas how to make it work thanks to skills aquired in VetsInTech Python course.  Thank You to Brion!
Initial plan
-Use tesseract to extract text from photos
-Use string/text to format the data
-Use Openpyxl to export data to worksheet for analysis
-Add any other features that I come up with.
