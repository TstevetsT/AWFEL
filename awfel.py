# Apple Workout Fitness Export Linker (AWFEL) -python script that takes pictures of your swim workout splits as an input, uses OCR to convert to text, exports to excel, and provides analysis on best swim intervals.
# This is a work in progress.  Have ideas how to make it work thanks to skills aquired in VetsInTech Python course.  Thank You to Brion!
# Initial plan
# -Use tesseract to extract text from photos
# -Use string/text to format the data
# -Use Openpyxl to export data to worksheet for analysis
# -Add any other features that I come up with.
